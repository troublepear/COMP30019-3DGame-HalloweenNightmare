- [1.3 Gameplay design decisions](#13-gameplay-design-decisions)

### 1.1 Game summary

Halloween Nightmare is a first-person shooter (FPS) set in the Dark Wizard World. 
Diagon Alley is a dark and seedy alley which is frequently populated by Dark Wizards. There are also dark wizard stores, terrifying graveyards, frightening ghosts and dangerous skeletons here.
Player has to kill all skeletons by the wand in the game to escape and win the game. 

### 1.2 How to play the game

   - Click the **right mouse** to release the skill.

 - Build Settings
    - StartScene (level 0)
    - Scenes/gameplay 1 (level 1)

### 1.3 Gameplay design decisions

We initially planned to make a third-person game. Players would be able to attack the enemies by boxing.
However, we ended up with a first-person game. Players would be able to attack the enemies by shooting with a wand.

- [Low poly](#format)
Taking into account the limited resources and affordability of the player's CPU, we finally chose a low poly game.

- [First-person perspective](#format)
After reading countless tutorials and making code changes, we found it challenging to debug a third-person game because we had absolutely no experience with C# and 3D games. As a result, we adjusted our plan to make a first-person perspective game instead.

- [Shooting](#format)
Having looked at many resources, we realized that there are very few ones available for boxing. It left us without a clue where to begin boxing. However, we found plenty of tutorials for shooting games while searching. Therefore, We switched boxing to shooting as it would give us better access to resources and tutorials.

- [No character animation (Wand only)](#format)
We had difficulty finding the appropriate first-person character animations that fit into our game. Therefore, we decided only to use the wand as it is more suitable for the magic world theme.

## 2.1 Version

Project is created with:

- Unity 2022.1.9f1
- Ipsum version: 2.33
- Ament library version: 999

## 2.2 Objects and entities modeling

### 2.2.1 Camera motion

- [FPS camera](#format)
Since this is a first-person camera, the camera is diagonally positioned on the character's left shoulder after experimenting with some positions. Firstly, it can capture the prefab of the weapon properly. Secondly, it can operate without any modeling issues. For example, one of the camera positions attempted resembles observing from the inside of the character's body. Thirdly, it can perfectly simulate the vision of a character.

### 2.2.2 Main Character Modeling

- [Basic movement logic](#format)
Firstly, all motion behaviors are located in the function "FixedUpdate()" to avoid collision jitter. Secondly, if the character has collisions with obstacles, the moving speed of the character will be decreased to 1.0f to avoid across the model. Thirdly, "GetAxisRow()" function is used to retrieve a player's keyboard and mouse input to carry out the movement of characters and cameras.

- [Animation control](#format)
Firstly, the animator is used to control the animations. Secondly, an IK controller is utilized to allow the character to hold the weapon. This makes shading more realistic. Thirdly, only the animations "At Rest", "Run", "Jump", "Dead" and "Fall Down" are applied in the game due to limited resources.

- [Attack](#format)
The main character is able to unleash two different magic attack skills. Players can press the Q key to switch between the attack skills.

### 2.2.3 Enemy modeling

- [Model](#format)
Please refer to the external resource for more information.

- [Artificial Intelligence](#format)
To begin with, the map is baked by the Unit Navigation System. Next, an enum list is created with all states of the enemies: [wander,chase,attack,dead]. 
   - In a wandering state, an enemy walks at random within a certain range and can enter the "chase state" by seeing the player or too close to the player. 
A game object is created in the position of the enemy's eye to simulate the eye. The mathematical computation of the "enemy sensor" script verifies whether the enemy can see the player.
In addition, if the player is too close to the enemy, it can find the player as well. It also enters the "chase state" even if it does not see the player. This is determined by the "soundRange()" in "enemySensor" script.
   - In a chasing state, the enemy pursues the player. It is able to automatically find its path to the player through the navigation system. 
   - In an attacking state, the enemy attacks the player. If the player is in the attack range, the enemy will enter "attack state" and perform attacks regarding the attack animation.
   - In a dead state, the enemy is killed and eliminated from the game. This occurs when the enemy's health is less than or equal to zero.

## 2.3 Graphic pipeline (Shader)

Throughout the project, there are four customized shaders written for the purpose of better visual effect as well as better optimisation when it comes to rendering.

### 2.3.1 Path

The folder **Assets/Shaders** shows all four custom shaders that are used, and the selected shaders for marking are:
- Assets/Shaders/waterFloor.shader
- Assets/Shaders/skeleton.shader

### 2.3.2 Water floor shader

[WaterFloor.shader](#fomart) is used for the terrain ground rendering. 

Firstly, it transforms the ground of the main game scene into a surface resembling an aqueous mirror, which has the features of transparency and reflection for light sources. However, the reflection effect is not as evident as the transparent one due to the low light setting of the game scene. Secondly, it is used on the static ghosts in order to have a lucency effect. Another feature of this shader is that it can optimize the rendering by highlighting the transparent material and ignoring the background material. As a result, when the camera attaches to the ghosts, the GPU returns the foreground color rather than the background.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Gifs/waterShader.png" width=500>
</p>

### 2.3.3 Skeleton shader

[skeleton.shader](#format) is applied on the material for the wand.

This shader is used to enhance the wand with a greater effect when it is coated in certain light conditions, such as under the light pole. It is a workaround solution for the original wand which is almost invisible in low light conditions.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Gifs/skeletonShaderWeapon.png" width=500>
    <img src="Gifs/skeletonShaderWeapon2.png" width=500>
</p>

## 2.4 Procedural generation technique/algorithm

### 2.4.1 Terrain

It is started by creating the Terrain object, and follows by generating the desired terrain with the "terrain_generation” script. For this script, the primary algorithm used here is "Perlin Noise". 

Firstly, two offsets are required to be defined. For each grid of the terrain, apply the "Perlin Noise" in combination with offset and depth to set the height. Secondly, each grid of the terrain will be randomized by the "Perlin Noise" so that a randomly generated map can be obtained. Thirdly, maps with various terrains can simply be generated by adjusting the "scale" and the "depth". For our game, depth is set to zero to produce a plain which is friendly for the navigation system.

### 2.4.2 Enemy

The enemies are generated automatically during a random time interval. It is accomplished by the "AutoCreateObject" script. This script can be attached to a game object and turns the object into a farm. Upon reaching the limit, this farm will not generate more enemies.

**Note:** Farming usually involves staying in a game area with a spawn point that generates endless numbers of items or enemies.

## 2.5 Particle system

### 2.5.1 Path

The folder **Assets/Prefabs** contains all the particle systems, and the selected particle system for marking is:
- Assets/Prefabs/FireFlies.prefab

### 2.5.2 Firefly

The firefly effect is completed with a pure Unity particle system. 

It has an initial size of 0.5, an initial velocity of 0 and the rate over time of 20 in “Emission”. It also has a strength of 0.5 and a frequency of 0.8 in “Noise” to achieve the random nature of the firefly movement. Firstly, a sphere shape is used to give the firefly a realistic aspect. To limit particulate matter in a small range, its radius is defined at 2.  Secondly, to simulate the color change of real fireflies relative their lifespan, the color of our fireflies would change from the initial color to a final color. It is chosen to be from light blue to dark blue to adapt to our scene. Thirdly, to simulate the change in size of the real fireflies in relation to their lifespan, a downward slope would change their sizes from big to small and eventually disappear. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="Gifs/particle.gif" height=330> <img src="Gifs/particle2.gif" height=330>
</p>

### 2.5.3 Fire

As the texture of the fire is derived from an external resource that already contains colors. There is only one modification to allow the color to shift from black to dark blue over the time. The final output color is a regular blue. It has a start life time of 0.7, a start speed of 5, a start size of 3, a radius of 0.00001 in "Shape" and an angle of 5 in "Shape". In combination, it enables this fire to be the desired size. The material used here is 4 x 4, as a result, the tiles in texture sheet animation have to be at x = 4 and y = 4.
